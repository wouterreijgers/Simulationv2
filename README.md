# Simulation
This code is a simple simulator to represent a hunter-prey model. To run the code, run the main.py class. The simulation will be started, every time unit is a second. The simulation stops when all hunters are dead or when you escape by clicking the (x) in the upper right corner. 
(this might be lagging so just keep clicking ;p)
